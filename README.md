(Optional Activity of the APCS Curriculum Elevens Lab) 

This activity creates simulations for both the elevens game and the thirteens game.

The simulation shows results like this: (as an example) 
Games won:    54
Games played: 100
Percent won:  54.0%


You are free to alter the number of the games to be played. You will see that the percentage won will get more consistent as more games are played (in other words, it varies less).
